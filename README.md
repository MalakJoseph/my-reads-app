### About the Project

- Udacity gave an app for books library created with [React](https://reactjs.org/).
- I managed to run the functions in a right way so you can:

1. Search for books in the input by title or authors
2. Move books between different shelves
3. Work on URLs to be updated based on your actions

### Steps to Run The Project

1. Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. npm is bundled with node.
